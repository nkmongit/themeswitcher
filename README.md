# ON LEARNING HOW REACT CONTEXT API WORKS

## THEME SWITCHER

```
THIS IS A BASIC APPLICATION ON SWITCHING THE UI THEME FROM LIGHT MODE TO DARK OR VICE VERSA
```

# USAGE

## `theme.js` FILE

- CREATED A CONTEXT CALLED `theme.js`
- WHERE I CREATED A CONTEXT CALLED `ThemeContext`
- WHICH HAS A VARIBALE CALLED `themeMode` WITH A DEFAULT VALUE OF `light`
- AND TWO METHODS THAT CAN AVAILABLE TO WHOLE CONTEXT
- `darkTheme`
- `lightTheme`

- IN THE SAME FILE I ALSO EXPORTED THE `ThemeProvider`

- MADE USE OF `useContext` HOOK AND PASSED MY `ThemeContext` CONTEXT INTO IT

## `App.jsx` FILE

- MADE USE OF `useState` AND PASSED `themeMode` FROM THE `ThemeProvider` AND A FUNCTION `setThemeMode`
- WHERE I CREATED TWO FUNCTIONS THAT I NAMED SAME AS THE METHODS I CREATED IN `ThemeContext`, THOSE ARE `lightTheme` AND `darkTheme`
- THEN WRAPPED I MY `App.jsx` FILE WITH THE `<ThemeProvider></ThemeProvider>` CONTEXT

## WORKING ON `ThemeButton` COMPONENT

- HERE I CREATED A `Checkbox` WHICH HAS A `onChange` ATTRIBUTE
- PASSING A FUNCTION CALLED `onChangeBtn`
- MADE USE OF MY CUSTOM HOOK FOR CHANGING COLOR THEME I IMPORTED `themeMode`, `darkTheme`, `lightTheme` FROM `useTheme` HOOK
- WITH THE HELP OF `onChangeBtn` I TARGETED THE CURRENT FROM THE EVENT CHECKED `e.target.checked` STORING IT IN A VARIABLE CALLED `darkModeStaus`

```Code
if(darkModeStatus) {
    darkTheme();
}
else
{
    lightTheme();
}
```
